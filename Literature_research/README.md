Guide to diversity indices and more
============

When I started reading the literature on diversity indices in microbial ecology, I received some really helpful articles from [Aisling Daly](http://www.kermit.ugent.be/phd%20students.php?navigatieId=92&categorieId=11). The recommended list filtered out a bunch of confusing papers. It also helped me to understand the issues on diversity indices in ecology.

For folks who want to get into the biodiversity debates in ecology, the list of articles below may be a good start.

## My thesis' objective
Change a microbial community's resistance to invasion by varying the species distribution of a community. 

## General Background
[Microbial Resource Management](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elsc.200620176/abstract) -- the paper lays the foundation for manipulating microbial communities from an ecological perspective. 

[Synthetic Microbial Communities](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24274586) -- Instead of sampling microbial communities from nature, assembling microbial communities is a good way to perform controlled experiments. 

[Practical tools for microbial ecology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18331337) -- some useful parameters to describe microbial communities. One meaningful parameter is species diversity index and evenness. 

## Species Diversity

An overview of the traditional species diversity can be found in: [Measuring Biological Diversity](www2.ib.unicamp.br/profs/thomas/NE002_2011/maio10/Magurran%202004%20c2-4.pdf). The problem of diversity indices? There are numerous species diversity indices and each expresses different things. So which diversity index is most useful? (In general Shannon-Wiener Index and Simpson index D is used.) 

[Diversity, biotic and similarity indices](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0043135484901647) -- an article that may be helpful, although it focuses mainly on aquatic ecosystems. 

## Species Evenness

A good start for learning about evenness indices is [A Consumer's Guide to Evenness Indices](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3545749).

## Alpha- and Beta diversity

[Commentary: do we have a consistent terminology for species
diversity? we are on the way.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21938639) addresses the issues with this terminology. Personally I would avoid using beta-diversity altogether. 

## True diversity
[Partitioning diversity into independent alpha and beta components](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/06-1736.1) - points out the issues beta-diversity and why Hill's work could solve some issues.

## Similarity-sensitive diversity
[Measuring diversity: the importance of species similarity](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/10-2402.1) - the crux of my thesis. I incorporate similarity data into my analysis and evaluate its usefulness.
