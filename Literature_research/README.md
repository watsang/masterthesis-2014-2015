Guide to diversity indices and more
============

When I started reading the literature on diversity indices in microbial ecology, I received some really helpful articles from [Aisling Daly](http://www.kermit.ugent.be/phd%20students.php?navigatieId=92&categorieId=11). The recommended list filtered out a bunch of confusing papers. It also helped in gaining a better understanding on the issues on diversity indices in ecology.

For folks who want to get into the biodiversity debates in ecology, the list of articles below may be a good start.

## My thesis' objective
Change a microbial community's resistance to invasion by varying the species distribution of a community. 

## General Background
[Microbial Resource Management](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elsc.200620176/abstract) -- the paper lays the foundation for manipulating microbial communities from an ecological perspective. 

[Synthetic Microbial Communities](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24274586) -- Instead of sampling microbial communities from nature, assembling microbial communities is a good way to perform controlled experiments. 

[Practical tools for microbial ecology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18331337) -- some useful parameters to describe microbial communities. One meaningful parameter is species diversity index and evenness. 

## Diversity indices.
=====================

The problem of diversity indices? There are numerous species diversity indices and there is no clear distinction about their usage or suitability fo
Which diversity index to choose? 

## Evenness

* Students looking for an example of an experimental design
* Microbiologist looking to build machine learning models on noisy data

This repository consists of a part about Labwork and a part about Modelling.
