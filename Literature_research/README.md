Guide to diversity indices and more
============

When I started reading the literature on diversity indices in microbial ecology, I received some really helpful articles from [Aisling Daly](http://www.kermit.ugent.be/phd%20students.php?navigatieId=92&categorieId=11). The recommended list filtered out a bunch of confusing papers. It also helped me to understand the issues on diversity indices in ecology.

For folks who want to get into the biodiversity debates in ecology, the list of articles below may be a good start.

## My thesis' objective
Change a microbial community's resistance to invasion by varying the species distribution of a community. 

## General Background
[Microbial Resource Management](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/elsc.200620176/abstract) -- the paper lays the foundation for manipulating microbial communities from an ecological perspective. 

[Synthetic Microbial Communities](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24274586) -- Instead of sampling microbial communities from nature, assembling microbial communities is a good way to perform controlled experiments. 

[Practical tools for microbial ecology](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18331337) -- some useful parameters to describe microbial communities. One meaningful parameter is species diversity index and evenness. 

## Species Diversity

The problem of diversity indices? There are numerous species diversity indices and each expresses different things. So which diversity index is most useful? An overview of the traditional species diversity can be found in: [Measuring Biological Diversity](www2.ib.unicamp.br/profs/thomas/NE002_2011/maio10/Magurran%202004%20c2-4.pdf). In general Shannon-Wiener Index and Simpson index D is used. 

An article that may be helpful, although it focuses mainly on aquatic ecosystems: [Diversity, biotic and similarity indices](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0043135484901647).

## Species Evenness

A good start for learning about evenness indices is [A Consumer's Guide to Evenness Indices](http://www.jstor.org/stable/3545749).

## Going further: Alpha- and Beta diversity

Alpha- and Beta diversity: introduced in [Vegetation of the siskiyou mountains, oregon and california](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1943563). 

[Commentary: do we have a consistent terminology for species
diversity? we are on the way.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21938639) addresses the issues with this terminology.

## True diversity
[Diversity and Evenness](http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.2307/1934352): Hill proposes True Diversity.
