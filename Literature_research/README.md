Guide to diversity indices and more
============

When I started reading the literature surrounding diversity indices in microbial ecology, I received some really helpful articles from [Aisling Daly](http://www.kermit.ugent.be/phd%20students.php?navigatieId=92&categorieId=11). 

Microbial ecology studies the relationships between micro-organisms and their environment. They can be described in terms of diversity indices.

These files might be interesting for:

* Students looking for an example of an experimental design
* Microbiologist looking to build machine learning models on noisy data

This repository consists of a part about Labwork and a part about Modelling.

All the files for the labwork can be found in [Labwork](./Labwork).
