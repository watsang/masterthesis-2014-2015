Assessing pathogen invasion based on community evenness and metabolic similarity
============

This is a guide through all my work for my master-thesis in the schoolyear 2014-2015.
The master thesis is a result of a collaboration between [LabMET] (http://www.labmet.ugent.be/) and [KERMIT] (http://www.kermit.ugent.be/) at Ghent University.

* Microbiologist looking to build machine learning models on noisy data

This repository consists of a part about Labwork and a part about Modelling.

The research questions that were tackled in my thesis mainly deal with synthetic microbial ecology. As pathogen increasingly gain antibiotic resistance, it becomes more interesting to look at the underlying factors of community structure to manipulate a community's resistance to invasion. One key factor that is explored is community evenness, i.e. the relative abundance of species in a community. It is reported in literature that communities with low evenness -- meaning strong domination by one species -- is more fragile than communities with high evenness -- i.e. communities where most species are equally abundant. 

A hypothesis was formulated that communities with high evenness are more resistant to invasion contrary to communities with low evenness. Lab experiments were set up where 194 synthetic communities consisting of 10 bacteria were assembled on a varying range of evenness. To find the optimal design 1000000 communities were simulated, after which a 94 were randomly selected and 100 according to a certain stratification.
