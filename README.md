Assessing pathogen invasion based on community evenness and metabolic similarity
============

This is a guide through all my work for my master-thesis in the schoolyear 2014-2015.
The master thesis is a result of a collaboration between [LabMET] (http://www.labmet.ugent.be/) and [KERMIT] (http://www.kermit.ugent.be/) at Ghent University.

These files might be interesting for:

* Students looking for an example of an experimental design
* Microbiologist looking to build machine learning models on noisy data

This repository consists of a part about Labwork and a part about Modelling.

All the files for the labwork can be found in [Labwork](./Labwork).
