Assessing pathogen invasion based on community evenness and metabolic similarity
============

This is a guide through all my work for my master-thesis in the schoolyear 2014-2015.
The master thesis is a result of a collaboration between [LabMET] (http://www.labmet.ugent.be/) and [KERMIT] (http://www.kermit.ugent.be/) at Ghent University.

These files might be interesting for:

* Students looking for an example of an [experimental design](./Labwork/Experimental Design)
* Microbiologist looking to build machine learning models on noisy data

This repository consists of a part about Labwork and a part about Modelling.

During the first semester I primarily worked in the lab. Bacterial communities were assembled and invaded with one pathogen each time. All the files for the labwork can be found in [Labwork](./Labwork). 

In the second semester, the data from the experiments was analysed. External data was pulled from the RAST-database and evaluated in the analysis. Finally, a simple recommender engine was built. The files can be found in [Modelling](./Modelling).

I wouldn't have understood the literature nearly as well without some helpful pointers. Folks who are interested to learn more about the role of diversity indices in microbial ecology can find this in [Literature_research](./Literature_research)
