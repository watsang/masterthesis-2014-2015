## Data preprocessing

You have downloaded the [Raw Data](../data_organism_reactions/Raw Data).
The order of processing is:

Order | File | Description
--- | ------------| -----------
1. | [ split_into_reactions.ipynb](./metabolic information/ split_into_reactions.ipynb) | Splits the initial table with reactions into stoichiometric matrices
2. | [process_environments.ipynb](./locations/process_environments.ipynb) | processes data about the locations
3. | [ filter_on_selected_bacteria.ipynb](./ filter_on_selected_bacteria.ipynb) | filters the raw data on the locations on the useful data for bacteria. 

## Next
Now that all data is processed. The data can finally be analysed: [analysis data](../analysis data).
