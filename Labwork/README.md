# Lab work

During the first semester I had the opportunity to work in the lab. I set up my some experiments by creating an experimental design with the help of my tutor [Michiel Stock](https://github.com/MichielStock). 

Raw data was generated and processed in the statistical analysis. 

## Objective
Testing whether communities with high evenness are more resistant to pathogen invasion than communities with low evenness. It has been shown by [Wittebolle et al.](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v458/n7238/full/nature07840.html) that initial community evenness influences a community's functionality. 

### The experimental design

The files for generating the experimental design can be found in [Experimental Design](./Experimental Design).

### Some details about lab experiments
The selection of the pathogen can be found in [pathogenlist](./pathogenlist). 

### The statistical analysis

The statistical analysis of the data can be found in [Statistical analysis](./Statistical analysis)

### Extra information
* The preliminary results for one pathogen was presented in a [presentation](./presentation). 

* The early results were analysed in [results december](./results december)
