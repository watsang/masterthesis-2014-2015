Hi,

The design was changed and seems more reasonable now. 
The best possible range that approximates our ideal design has 40 points each in the high and low levels,
where high = 1 to 0.8 evenness, while low = 0 to .2 evenness.
4 concentrations were used from 10^7 to 10^4.
10^3 was skipped because less than 1 in final experiment was agreed to be unquantifiable anymore.

The final eveness distribution can be viewed in hist(evenness).jpg.
The R-file to generate this can be found in design_coculture_september1.R.
The generated matrix for pipetting in design.xlsx, and the file spawned by the R file in  design.csv.
Cellcount vs evenness.jpg shows that the two variables are now quite orthogonal with a final correlation of -0.24.

Kind Regards,
Wai Kit
